Hello and welcome back. In this video, we're going to explore an essential document that will play a key role throughout your studies, your program regulations. Now I know this may not sound like the most exciting part of your learning journey, but trust me, understanding these regulations is crucial to your success. Our task today isn't to dive into every single rule and guideline in the document. It's our job as module leaders and program conveners to make sense of what can and cannot be done. But rather, this is to understand how we can break it down into something useful and accessible for new students like yourselves. It also means you get a good understanding about how things are structured and why we can or cannot do certain things. 
So what exactly are program regulations? In simple terms, program regulations are the set of rules, requirements and guidelines that outline how your degree is structured, what's expected of you and what you need to do to successfully complete your course. These include key details like the modules you're required to take contingent upon your pathway, credit requirements for passing and progressing through your degree, assessment criteria, for example, an exam, a coursework or a mix of both, the conditions under which you may need to repeat or withdraw from a module or a course, for example, if you get a grade of 20%. While these regulations are technical, they aren't tied to specific technologies or systems like coding languages. Instead they focus on the rules of the game that guide your academic journey. These often change, but you will generally follow the guidelines you've signed up for when you first enrolled. I've worked at seven different universities now in the general field of computer science, and you'd be surprised how much these can vary. 
You might be wondering, why should I care about program regulations? Here's why they matter. First of all, they provide clarity. Program regulations give you a clear roadmap for your degree. They tell you what you can and can't do, and they ensure you stay on track towards your goals. Understanding them early will help you avoid unexpected issues like not meeting a prerequisite or missing a key assessment. A degree is a pretty complex and time-consuming undertaking, so you need to know exactly what you can and can't do to get the most out of your time here. 
They help you to navigate challenges. Throughout your studies, you may encounter situations where you need to make important decisions, whether it's about changing modules, understanding reassessment policies, or knowing when and how to apply for special circumstances. The program regulations will guide you in these moments. The regulations set expectations. These regulations define your responsibilities as a student. They outline what the institution expects from you in terms of attendance, submission deadlines, and academic integrity. Following these rules is key to avoiding penalties or delays in your progress. 
Although you're working remotely for the most part, some on-campus degrees require a certain level of attendance or engagement. Perhaps we should make it compulsory for you to spend 100 hours on the platform for each module. No, of course not. That wouldn't be fair. The expectations have to be reasonable on both yourselves and us as the academic leadership team. Finally, they support your success. Program regulations are designed to help you to succeed. 
They set the framework that ensures fairness and academic standards across all students. By understanding them, you're equipping yourselves to make informed decisions throughout your degree. These rules are for us as much as they are for you. Now for the practical part. Your task is to take the detailed program regulations for your specific course of study and summarise them into a short guide for new students. But why summarise them? New students, just like you once were, often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information they're given at the start of their course. 
A concise, easy-to-read summary of the program regulations can help them quickly understand what's important and avoid common mistakes. And summarising them is a great exercise in technical writing, a skill we've already touched on in the previous lesson. Here's how you can approach this exercise. Start by skimming the document. First, take a broad look at the full document. Don't worry about absorbing all the details right away, just get familiar with the structure. Look for the key sections like module requirements, assessment policies, progression rules and any special circumstances or appeals processes. 
What stands out to you as important? Is anything superfluous or just damn right useless? Identify the most important information. Your goal is not to recreate the entire document, but to pull out the most essential points. Focus on what a new student really needs to know to get started. What are the core rules? What should they pay attention to in the first year? 
Some key areas to consider are core modules and optional modules. What must they take and when? Assessment criteria. How will they be graded? What are the pass marks? Progression rules. What do they need to do to move from one year to the next? 
Reassessment or retake policies. What happens if they don't pass? Use clear, simple language. When writing your summary, keep it concise and easy to understand. Remember, this is an exercise in technical writing. Use bullet points or headings to break up information and avoid jargon where possible. The aim is to make it as accessible as possible to new students, some of whom might be unfamiliar with academic terms. 
Keep it objective. You're writing a guide based on factual information. Avoid giving opinions or advice. Stick to the key rules and guidelines that are outlined in the document. Be careful with text summarizers. I recently tried to get an answer to a program regulations question utilizing a fairly popular large language model, not saying any names. In the first instance, it produced incorrect information. 
When I queried this, it doubled down and lied to me. I didn't know the answer, but I knew that the answer it produced wasn't feasible. These tools are great, don't get me wrong, but please don't put too much trust in them. Let's talk briefly about the format of your summary. Aim to keep your guide short and to the point. Two pages should be sufficient. Use headings and subheadings to break the information into sections, such as modules and credits, assessment and grading, and special circumstances. 
Where possible, use bullet points or numbered lists to present information clearly and concisely. Can you turn everything into a single table? Think of this as a quick reference guide. It should be something a new student can read through in a few minutes and feel confident about the key rules. This could even make up a part of your portfolio. It's a useful exercise and one you should have a go at. Now you might be wondering how this task fits into your broader learning in this module. 
Here's why this exercise is valuable. Summarizing a technical document like program regulations is a great way to practice communicating complex information clearly and concisely. It's an essential skill you'll use in many areas of computer science, from writing project reports to creating user documentation. Sometimes you might only have a page or two minutes to articulate some complex concept. Use that space or time effectively, and people will appreciate it. By summarizing the program regulations, you're actually reinforcing your own understanding of the document. You'll become more familiar with the rules that will guide your academic journey, which will help you to avoid pitfalls later on. 
Summarizing information and presenting it in a clear, structured format is a key skill when working in teams. Whether you're presenting findings to a technical team or explaining a process to non-technical stakeholders, the ability to distill complex information into clear summaries is highly valued in the workplace. To wrap things up, this task is all about helping you to develop the technical writing skills you'll need throughout your studies and future career. By summarizing the program regulations, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to break down a complex document into something more accessible, something that will benefit both you and new students coming into the program. Take your time, focus on clarity, and remember to stick to the most important points. Once you've completed your summary, you'll be one step closer to mastering the art of technical writing, and you'll have a handy reference for the rest of your academic journey. Thank you for watching, and good luck with your summary. 
I look forward to seeing what you produce.
