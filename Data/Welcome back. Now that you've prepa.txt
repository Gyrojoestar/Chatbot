Welcome back. Now that you've prepared your mobile app pitch presentation, it's time to think about how we'll evaluate both the style and the content of these presentations. Whether you're pitching to investors, a project team, or users, delivering your message clearly and effectively is key. To help guide you, we're going to introduce a set of heuristics to evaluate the quality of your pitch from a communication perspective. Let's start with content. A successful presentation needs to be well-organized and easy to follow. Here are some heuristics to keep in mind. Logical flow. Is your presentation structured in a way that logically takes the audience from the problem to the solution? A good flow might begin with the pain point your app addresses, followed by the key features, and end with the potential impact. Simplicity and focus. Avoid overwhelming your audience with too much detail. 
Instead, focus on the core features and benefits of your app. Ask yourself, have I clearly articulated the app's main value proposition in a way that's easy to grasp? Audience appropriateness. Tailor your language and depth of detail to your audience. For technical stakeholders, dive into the features. For non-technical audiences, focus on the user experience and business potential. This is so difficult to do for these videos because I don't have an audience. It's much easier to teach in class as I can see faces and look for reactions. 
You might be falling asleep right now and I wouldn't even know. Tragic. Now let's look at the style of delivery, which is just as important as the content. Confidence and enthusiasm. Are you speaking with confidence? Enthusiasm is contagious and your audience will be more likely to engage with your idea if you show passion for your app. Remember, you're not just selling the app, you are selling your belief in it. Clear and concise communication. Are you using clear, concise language? Avoid jargon unless it's appropriate for your audience. Be mindful of speaking too quickly or too slowly. Balance is key. I know that I talk too fast and I have to be really conscious of it, especially because I drink so much coffee. Visual aids and support materials. Visual aids should enhance, not distract. Make sure slides or demo materials are clean, focused, and support your key points. Are your visuals helping to clarify your message or are they cluttered and confusing? Have a look at my heuristics or the big poster we presented. That was A1 size but could still be interpreted by different audiences because we had a colourful flow and visuals to help. Audience interaction. Pay attention to how you engage the audience. Are you making eye contact, posing for questions, or checking for understanding? Remember, presenting is a two-way street. You're not just delivering information, you're connecting with your audience. TED Talks are great examples of this. Often abstract concepts are presented in an interesting way to pique curiosity and interest. 
These lectures aren't really about telling you everything you need to know, more so helping you to navigate complex concepts and access the reading and activities more easily. To summarise, here are the key heuristics for evaluating your presentation. Logical flow and simplicity of content. Confidence, clarity, and visual engagement in delivery. Audience appropriateness and interaction. As you prepare to deliver your pitch, reflect on these areas and consider how you can improve both the content and your delivery style. Good communication is about making your message clear, engaging, and memorable.
