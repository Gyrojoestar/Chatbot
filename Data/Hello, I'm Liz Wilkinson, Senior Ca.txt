Hello, I'm Liz Wilkinson, Senior Careers Consultant with the University of London Career Service. Throughout this module, I will be talking to you about how the skills you are learning will help you get hired for the jobs you want and develop your longer term career. I will be interviewing industry professionals, sharing their insights on effective working in technology. And I will also be signposting you to some fantastic resources from the Career Service that can support you on your career's journey. In this lecture, I'm going to outline why assertive communication skills, both written and spoken, matter so much in the development of your career and how you can develop your communication skills using the free resources of the University of London Career Service. More assertive communication skills will improve your approach at every phase of your job hunting. You will have more informative conversations when networking and information gathering. Your CV and applications are more likely to be shortlisted and your interview performance will be more persuasive. And when you finally get a job offer, you will be well equipped to negotiate a good salary. So for every percent of conscious improvement of your communication skills, you will get a very good return on investment. So why do employers and recruiters care about the skill of communication? They highlight communication skills in job ads because staff with assertive communication skills are essential in delivering good products and results for organisations. Good communicators are more effective in team working, resolving conflict with colleagues, keeping their managers briefed on what they need to know, and dealing effectively with customers, stakeholders, and investors. Assertive communicators improve the financial performance and viability of any organisation. And that is why good communication skills are keenly sought by employers. Let's now unpack the concept of communication skills. I have deliberately chosen the term assertive communication skills because it aligns to some key aspects of effective communication in a career development context. Assertiveness is the middle way between passive communication and aggressive communication. What is considered an assertive tone can vary according to cultural context, but whatever the context, assertive communication has three key elements. 
One, some understanding of the likely priorities of the reader or audience. What do they care about? What do they worry about? Two, some understanding of the relevant facts and evidence to support what you are arguing. Three, a clear and relevant line of argument to follow and often a clear, positive suggestion of what we should do next to move things forward. Take a moment to think about the people you work and study with. Who are the most assertive communicators? How does their communication style move things forward and how might that make them a more valuable hire? This links into global employability skills as communication is one of the 10 global employability skills which we at the University of London Career Service have identified as being in demand by employers across the globe. Also linked to assertive communication skills is persuasion and negotiation, another of the 10 global employability skills. Both are fundamental to your ability to work well with others and they form a key part of the human advantage in an AI enriched environment. Assertive communication becomes more important in an AI enriched world. Effective use of AI can help you improve the clarity of your arguments as well as spelling and grammar and the University of London Career Service provides you with digital tools which use AI smartly to improve your CVs and applications. However, it still takes a human to think through what would convince another human and in job hunting context there is no one better than you to figure how all your education and professional experience matches the recruiter's requirements. 
A common recruiter complaint is that now that AI tools are commonly available they now receive too many bland over-generalised CVs. So even if you use AI to get you started in your draft and improve the targeting of your CV or application statements, you will still need to read it through and add your personalised touch. Let's now look at how assertive communication can improve a CV or application. Think like the recruiter. You start with some thought about what the recruiter is looking for, what they are worrying about and what problem is this job created to solve. What do they need reassurance about? Will the new recruit stay? Can they turn the work around to spec and deadline? Will they fit into the team? Have they got a good work ethic? Backing up your statements with evidence. Think about your evidence of skills, not only your technical skills but also your broader global employability skills that make such a difference to your effectiveness in the workplace. How are you showing the results and the impact of your skills? For application statements the STAR approach can provide a good framework. S stands for a brief description of the situation. T stands for the task that you tackled. A stands for the actions you took. This should be the biggest section with four or five strong verbs describing a series of actions. R stands for results and positive impact on the business. The second R stands for reflection. What did you learn? 
What would you do differently? Check the clarity and relevance of your targeted argument. When you write a CV or application statement you are making an argument that your experiences and skills, both technical and global employability skills, will make you impactful in this job role in this specific working environment. So, take time to re-read the job description and the organisation's website. Is it obvious from your CV or application that you are applying for this particular job? Have you highlighted your most relevant evidence to make it clear that you are a good match for this job? The University of London Career Service is here to help you. We provide webinars, guidelines and AI enhanced tools to help you hone your CVs and applications. And our global employability skills micro-module has a whole section on technical communication skills to help you develop these skills further. You will find more detail on these resources in the sections that follow.
