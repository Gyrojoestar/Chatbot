Hello and welcome. In this session, we're going to dive into an important concept, design heuristics, and how they can guide the development of better digital audio workstations, or DAWs, to enhance music production workflows. By the end of this video, you'll have a better understanding of how to identify key usability issues in DAWs and how to draft your own heuristics based on research findings. We'll be drawing on a specific example from my own research, which I'll walk you through today. Before we jump into examples, let's take a moment to define what design heuristics are. Design heuristics are broad guidelines that help designers create more usable systems. They aren't rigid rules, but instead flexible principles that can be adapted to different types of systems, including DAWs. They can help you design better systems and help evaluate flaws in existing propositions. Design and evaluation go hand in hand. For example, some classic usability heuristics include consistency and standards, making sure that similar actions are performed in similar ways across the system. 
Imagine having the maximize window button appear somewhere different every time you open an application. How annoying would that be? Error prevention, helping users avoid mistakes before they happen. In the context of DAWs, these heuristics can help ensure that the tools musicians and producers use are intuitive, efficient, and supportive of creativity to prevent users getting lost in complexity. You can produce heuristics for pretty much anything. How to drive, how to eat a sandwich, how to make a cup of tea. There's even an ISO standard for that too. It's a set of abstract do's and don'ts for anything you can interact with. DAWs have become essential tools for musicians, producers, and engineers, but as the complexity of these systems increases, usability often suffers. 
If you want to see some of these tools in action, pop over to Google Images and type in digital audio workstation. You will see some of the most complex and colorful designs in any software system ever produced. It's really difficult to design these things as they have so many features and functions. When we think about music production, especially in a fast-paced or collaborative setting, flow and engagement are key. Usability problems can disrupt creativity, slowing down the process and making it harder to complete projects. That's where heuristics come in. By establishing key design principles, we can help DAW developers create tools that support creativity rather than obstruct it. The challenge, however, is balancing usability with the complexity inherent in music production. As we'll see in the examples from my research, the aim is to avoid overwhelming users with too many options or too much complexity, while still providing the powerful features they need. 
Whether designing a new DAW or redesigning an old one, there are general lessons to be learned that do not require user input or even user testing. Heuristics are rules-driven approaches, often based on lots of experience or even sometimes from rigorous A-B or multivariate user testing. In my research, I conducted a series of workshops and ran focus groups with professional musicians and producers. The goal was to identify common usability problems they encountered with DAWs and generate ideas for improvements. Notice first how I describe the roles. This is important because we can then start to consider if the system actually works for these types of people. Participants were split into three core roles. 
Performers – musicians who are primarily focused on live performance or composition. Producers – technologists who work primarily indoors, editing, mixing and arranging music. Agents – stakeholders who support the production process like managers or label representatives. These roles revealed different priorities and usability concerns. For instance, producers wanted efficient workflows, while performers valued flexibility and creative freedom. This makes sense as a live performance is likely to manifest differently to a more deliberate set of tweaks that is required of a mixing or mastering engineer. Let's explore some of the key tables and visuals from the research that show how these findings led to the creation of heuristics for DAWs. One of the first exercises in the research was identifying usability challenges. 
Too much control. Too many features cluttered the screen and confused the user. Participants wanted a cleaner interface with fewer distractions during creative tasks. Poor workflow. Users struggled to see the flow of their work, making it difficult to understand where they were in the process of production. Unclear metaphors or symbols. DAWs often used icons and symbols that didn't match real-world instruments, causing confusion. 
Inconsistent controls. Controls behaved differently across different sections of the software, leading to inefficiencies and frustration. The table is a great example of how we can take real-world usability problems and map them to specific heuristics. For instance, if a system has too many controls cluttering the screen, we can apply the heuristic of efficiency to guide developers towards a more streamlined interface. This actually makes sense when you imagine an analog counterpart. 20 guitar pedals on the floor is easy to visualize and map the flow of. They all light up. They're all interconnected in a linear fashion. Unfortunately, most desktop monitors aren't 15 feet wide, so we can see this problem manifest in real-time. Notice how the table provides a speedy look-up mechanism. 
After identifying issues, participants were encouraged to suggest solutions based on their workflow challenges. Enabling real-time collaboration and direct commenting within DAWs to streamline communication. Simplify controls with one-click functionality to reduce the user's cognitive load. Improve organization with filtering options to quickly find relevant tracks. These solutions directly inform the design heuristics that were developed. By focusing on problems such as clustered interfaces and inefficient workflows, the participants were able to recommend practical changes that could enhance creativity and usability. A lot of these aren't new features requested as part of the workflow, but some of them are about simplifying repeated processes into something more manageable. 
Another key finding from the research was the importance of dynamic roles in the music production process. The roles of performer, producer, and agent often shifted throughout a project, and the DAW needed to support these transitions fluidly. One of my future papers actually presents this as a Venn diagram, which is much easier to understand. You could even go further and use something like a concept diagram. You can see examples of these in the paper I wrote with staff at Cambridge, Edinburgh-Napier, and Brighton universities respectively. What this shows is that complex visuals can be presented in accessible ways, a key skill. The heuristic here would be flexibility, ensuring that the DAW can adapt to different roles and workflows seamlessly, without forcing users into a rigid process. Rather than taking a task-based approach, I can flip to a user-centric view that encapsulates any and all requirements of these users. 
Now it's your turn. Based on what we've explored today, your task is to draft a set of design heuristics that could improve some given system. Try to pick something complex like the DAW example. Maybe an integrated development environment, an IDE with all the bells and whistles, and plugins, would be good. Here are some steps to help you get started. Start with identifying key usability issues. Reflect on the challenges you've encountered in technical systems. What frustrates you? What slows down your workflow? Can you find evidence of these being problematic or design guidelines that suggest best practice? 
Relate these issues to heuristics. For each problem, think about which design heuristic might solve it. Is the issue related to efficiency, consistency, or error prevention? Nielsen, Norman, and Schneiderman all produce their own heuristics for general cases, but try to focus on a context-specific domain where the rules might be a bit more nuanced. Try to propose practical solutions. Once you've identified the issues and mapped them to heuristics, suggest improvements. How could the interface or workflow be simplified or enhanced? Sometimes this is as easy as taking a good and bad example and seeing strengths and weaknesses. 
In conclusion, moving forward with heuristics. Design heuristics provide us with a powerful tool to evaluate and improve complex systems like DAWs. By focusing on core principles like efficiency, learnability, and flexibility, we can create systems that support creativity while maintaining usability. It's essentially a table with possibly some numbers around severity and maybe some colors to determine prevalence. They're incredibly useful though to improve your workflow and make you super efficient. Now it's time for you to draft your own heuristics based on the findings we've discussed and your own experiences. Remember, the goal isn't to oversimplify the system, but to ensure that it's powerful enough to support complex work while being intuitive and efficient. 
Thank you for joining me today, and I look forward to seeing the heuristics you come up with. Let's make the world a better place, one design guideline at a time. Feel free to dip into other techniques to help visualize this, like the flowcharts we saw, tables of requirements, or something else that helps bring the concept to life.
