So, in today's exercise, we're going to look at some example documentation. So, we're going to have a look at my thesis document, which was conducted as part of my PhD. Now, this document is a fairly comprehensive one. It's an in-depth study, of course, it's a PhD, so it takes about three years to finish a PhD. It's quite a large body of work. The fundamental work of this was made up of three independent studies all linked together through some kind of thematic concept. And that's how a PhD is typically formed. It's three independent studies that are usually published, and then there's a narrative, a rhetoric that runs between those things that connects it all together as a thesis, as a document, which you can read by itself holistically from start to finish as a set of constructs around an idea, a research proposition that's then brought to fruition with three kind of independent studies that sit alongside this narrative that runs through it. So, those independent pieces of work are research contributions, usually novel contributions in that they are moving research on in some capacity or bounds. And then within that, there's a discussion, there's a discursive element to this, where you talk about what the ramifications of these things are, what the impact of the research is, and you connect all the dots. So, you do the prerequisite work, then you go off and do some independent work, and then you step back and you reflect upon all of those things. So, that's what this document does essentially, is it summarises all these key points in a very specific and both general way. So, we'll look at both the specifics and the general aspects through this exercise to get a sense of how we could structure our own document and how we might want to engage in our own research to get the most out of the time that we have. So, typically, most documents will start with a title, a summary of what they're about. You'll have an author, some of the bits and pieces in there relevant to the institution, etc., etc. Now, the first thing you typically come across is what's known as an abstract. Now, we've probably heard this word before, we've probably heard this word used in a lot of different ways, but an abstract in the context of a document is essentially a way to summarise the key elements, the key takeaways from the document itself. So, you'll say, this is a research project about a thing, we explored these things, we did X, Y, and Z, and these were the general outcomes. Now, your abstract tends not to have things like citations in there, it tends not to go into too much detail, although there may be some specifics in there. So, for smaller research papers, for instance, you might include a summary of the number of participants to think about generalisability, or you might even include some general summary statistics in there just to give a sense of the kind of overarching themes and ideas conceptually and how they're being teased out as part of this process. The point of the abstract really is to help readers understand what the research is about without actually having read the research. And if you're engaging with a research activity, this is really useful for you, the abstract should be the first thing that you read. For me, when I'm looking at research papers, I'm trying to find relevant research, the first thing I tend to do is I'll have a look at the abstract and I'll say, okay, what is it that we've got in here that's useful to me? Am I actually going to go any further with this discovery process? Or is this outside of the scope of my research? So I might read this and say, yes, I think it's relevant. 
I'm going to continue trying to find the things that I'm looking for within this document, because I think there might be something here, or no, I'm going to discard this because it's not relevant to the type of thing I'm doing, or it doesn't cover the right methods or approaches. So when you're looking at the abstract, you're often trying to identify at a very early stage whether or not this is a relevant piece of research to what you're doing. So you typically be skimming for keywords, like, you know, you might find software packages and go, okay, I think that's relevant. You know, they engaged in some methodologies that implored things like workshops, discussion groups. Okay. They were looking at aspects like user satisfaction. So straight away, you can get the general themes and ideas from the research. They've already started to impose some structure on the research here as well. So I can see that there's some analytic lens, some discursive lens. They've imposed some heuristics or created some heuristics from scratch. So again, that will help me to understand if this is relevant. 
Now we're not going to go through this in order. We're actually going to go through this as if we are external researchers. So I'm imagining I'm reading my thesis as somebody who's coming along, maybe starting my own PhD, or I'm an undergraduate student who's trying to identify some key research. So the next thing I do once I'd read the abstract will be to go ahead and I go and read the evaluations and the conclusions. So I'd skim all the way down to the bottom and go, okay, what are they talking about right at the bottom of the document? And if I go down here, I can start to see some of the strengths and limitations of the work. I can identify some of the key outcomes, the summary findings. 
And then from there, I might decide that I'm actually going to spend some time looking at the research in specific aspects of what they've done and take their approach. But I would start typically with the abstract, then move on to the evaluation. Then I might have a quick skim through the introduction. And then finally, I might read the whole paper. So that's a good way to think about your research in starting with the abstract, moving to the end of the paper, looking at the evaluation, and then skimming through to see if there's any other key aspects before you go ahead and commit a huge amount of time to researching and reading in this space. So that's a good way to approach your research. Now within the context of this document, we're really interested in the structure too. So we're going to spend some time talking about the structure. So as we scroll down, we can start to see that a structure has actually been imposed on this document. So this is really helpful when you're producing your own documents to help other people navigate the information architecture. It's a bit like when you're building a website, you have that navigational structure along the top or down the left hand side, from top to bottom or left to right, which usually gives you a sense of what the key themes and ideas are. 
So if you're looking for groceries and you're on a grocery shopping website, you'll see some general headings, the sections that they think will be relevant. So you might have a section for dairy, or you might have a section for kind of staples, key items that you purchase every week, and so on and so forth. Same with the document, it has an information architecture, and it should have a structure that looks roughly like this. You'll notice within this, we've got some tables inside our tables. So we have a table of figures, which is a key one. And we also have a table of tables, which sounds like a really meta way of doing things, but actually being able to navigate the key aspects of the document, particularly if you want to make reference to these later on, if you're doing external research, that's looking back at this stuff, having access to these things. Because for me, these are some of the key outcomes of the research. Quite a lot of the time, the key outcomes from research are either represented visually as figures, or as that kind of XY structure. 
How does X compare to Y? How can we compare these two things to one another, and start to identify at that analytical level, key things that are going on. Within this structure, we've also got other things. We've got chapters, and then we've got headings and subheadings. So we've got a numerical format for this. So chapter one is of course, the introduction. That's where we'll have lots of research, we'll have our literature review, we'll have some formal outcomes that describe what's gone on in previous research, that connects the contemporary stuff that we're doing here, to the stuff that's happened previously. 
So we're looking back and going, these are all the other bits of research that have happened in this space. This is where we're going to move from. And then you start to move towards the more formal aspects. So things like your methodology, your approach to the research, and then the actual research itself as you move through the chapters. But the early phases are really about identifying those key aspects. So what you might see with a document is a formal introduction chapter, you might see a formal literature review chapter as the first thing. It might be interspersed within the document, so there might not be a formal literature review, you might find that it falls across lots of these early categories. 
But generally speaking, for most research documents, you'll have a literature review chapter, particularly for long ones. For shorter papers, the literature review might be included in the introduction chapter, or it might actually stretch across multiple chapters. If for instance, it's a mixed methods approach to research, where they're trying to tease out lots of complexities, and the discussion is emerging from a connection of the contemporary, the contemporary research, and trying to connect those dots together to understand what the broader implications are. So again, this is a stylistic consideration. It's not that you have to do it one way or another, it will largely depend on what field you're working in. But when you're writing your early research papers, I'd probably suggest you start by writing a formal literature review chapter, probably quite early on in the process, to help to set the scene for the work to come. If you create these citations early on in the work, it allows you to refer back to them as you go, which can be really helpful, and it frames your discussion around what's already happening. Now scientific discourse isn't about necessarily creating the newest, most interesting thing, but you're actually drawing on lots of resources to try to bring them to the point of discussion at which you can then start to tease out some new, complex bits of information. But you have to look at that prerequisite first. Before trying to identify new things, you need to look back at what's already been done to substantiate your claims, to have a look to make sure you're not treading on somebody else's toes, you're not copying work that's already been done, that actually the work you're producing is new, is interesting, is novel, is contemporary, all of those things. And to do that, you have to frame that against an existing structure. 
And in the context of most research exercises, this is a chapter that includes lots of citations, i.e. a literature review or some formal chapter to describe those processes. Now within each of these sections, we've got subheadings. So for the shorter sections, for instance, we have just a handful of subsections here. So we've got subsections one to six, and we've only gone two subheadings deep here because it's not a particularly introspective discussion. There's not a huge amount happening here. So there's two subheadings are enough to allow us to dip down into a slightly lower level of discussion. So we can talk about the structure, how this document is structured. We can talk about the chapters that have some kind of investigative nature, some aims, objectives, etc., etc. So we start at a fairly high level here in the first chapter. We only go down two subheadings deep because the discussion is not particularly nuanced. When we move to chapter two, we start to see some content appearing so we can see the gaps between the pages getting much longer as we're starting to kind of build up speed. We're starting to accelerate more quickly and move on to new concepts and ideas more quickly. Because this is a literature review chapter, that's not particularly surprising. So we talk about things like the early usability research from the 90s, characters like Jakob Nielsen, Donald Norman, Ben Schneiderman, the kind of fundamental research that underpins this work. And quite a lot of the time, you'll find that the early work in your literature review goes back as far as you possibly can to the very early pioneers in the research space. And then you move towards the more contemporary things as you kind of step up the discussion. You'll also typically have a methods chapter in a lot of research articles. Now, you might not necessarily see these in every type of article that you engage with, but generally speaking, you'd have some kind of methods or methodology chapter that would describe a process. So this is typically like a set of ingredients could be compiled in such a way as to give instructions on how to make those ingredients into a meal, into a particular substantial version of those smaller component parts. 
So the methodological approach is really just a set of instructions of how to turn those ingredients into something substantial, i.e. a meal, or it might be how to bake a cake or something along those principles. And the research methods chapter is essentially that it's a way to encapsulate the approach that you've taken to research. Traditionally, this was thought of as a way, a means by which the research could be replicated. If you imagine scientific experiments, that's the way I tend to conceptualize this. So your science classroom, when you were studying science as a student, you may have found that you had lots of beakers and you were kind of heating things up and combining chemicals together in different proportions. Well, methods chapter is essentially a description of that process. So what you did at each step at each phase, how you combine things in what proportions, the methods chapter tends to be heavily driven around the empirical data that you're collecting. And largely for computer science-based studies, what you'll find is that there's lots of metrics imposed on things. 
So ways to measure things. So we measure things according to some structure, centimetres for height, for instance, we might measure weight in pounds or kilos. So we have those approaches that we can take to trying to encapsulate the approach that we took to research so that other people can think about the environment that you engaged in, the apparatus, the resources, the process, the step-by-step process. For instance, for my research, I've got a category for open coding where we identified core themes and we started to try to fold those down into smaller conceptual ideas. So a series of themes of the research, we look through everything that we do and then we collapse things into structures. So we go, okay, there's five core themes in here or there's 10 core themes in here, 100 core themes. And then we start to fold that down even more into something that vaguely resembles a structure or an ontology. 
So within the structure, again, we tend to focus on subheadings that are appropriate to the level of depth of the discussion. So here, because there's lots of new themes emerging and these are all categories by themselves, we actually go another subheading level deep. So we go from 3.1 up here and 2.5 that we're using here to three subheadings deep. So 3.1.1 as it becomes more detailed, as it becomes more granular in terms of focus. And then the research itself kind of summarizes each section. So this is something you'll probably want to do as part of your own research. When you're giving your document structure to start out with things like considerations and end with some summary within those sections. So you don't just have a summary section right at the end of the document that tries to bring everything together. You have a summary which kind of leads into the next section to give the document some kind of emergent flow. Say, OK, this is what we found out. This is what we're probably going to do next. And then the introduction chapter for the next chapter can actually build upon that. So we go, this is where we're going. OK, we're going to start on this new journey now in the introduction. And that's the idea behind this process. So as we move to chapter four, we can start to see some empirical work being done. We have those three subheadings deep and we look at the more detailed focus thing again. It's starting to become a rather lengthy document now. So we have to impose a new set of structural components on this. And for the empirical work that we've done, we've got categories and categories inside categories and categories inside categories inside categories. So we can see that there's a structure imposed upon that there. For each one of these, they're kind of separate studies. So what I was talking about there, the idea of three independent studies, you can think of each chapter as a study. Each chapter is essentially a paper. 
So this could be a research paper. Chapter five, ethnographic exploration of music systems in context could be a research paper. And in fact, quite a lot of the work from this was published in some way, shape or form, whether it was a poster presentation of some of the ideas or concepts at a low level to the more kind of empirically rigorous. data at a high level, at maybe a major journal or conference proceedings. So again, a PhD thesis or something substantial, maybe a book that you're reading, might be made up of lots of smaller components, smaller papers, smaller bits of research that are all brought together to have a more substantial engagement with the discourse. And this is essentially what a PhD or a book or something of that level of depth is really covering. Whereas you might also see short papers or works in progress, which could be one or two pages long, for instance, which is one key thing that's just been discovered or is emerging. And both are valid types of research. The level of discourse usually depends on how contemporary it is and what's happening within that space. So a shorter paper might be a new discovery in AI or machine learning, for instance. A longer paper might be a more kind of interesting systematic discourse around the tools and techniques used in the space. So again, each method is appropriate for purpose. Each mode of research, as we see them, has some general way of approaching the research space and also a way to communicate with a larger audience. So again, this is a structure we see, so lots of larger chapters now with sections and subsections. The key thing I want you to take away from this is that when you're imposing some structure on your documents, or when you're trying to interpret a document to understand its structure and get at the stuff that's useful, when you're trying to skim through this and find things that are relevant, what you want to do is take a systematic approach to it. So as I said, start out with the abstract, which gives you a general summary of the research, then move to the evaluation chapter. So you start out with the abstract, move down to the evaluation and read those things. So the evaluation and conclusion would be the second and third thing I'd probably read if I was looking at this externally. I'd get to the end of that and I'd have a general sense of not just what the research was about, but the approaches they've taken, the methodology, the outcomes, the interesting discourse. 
From there I could make a decision about whether or not this is worth referencing, whether or not this is worth reading, spending my time trying to discover more about this research, or whether it's irrelevant to my discussion. So again, what you're wanting to do is try to maximise your time and be efficient, make sure that when you're looking for these documents and you're trying to find things in your own literature reviews and your searches, that you're able to discern the research that's valid for your specific research question, versus things that are irrelevant. And of course, when you're creating these structures yourself for other people to engage in, to be a good scientist you want your research to be as accessible as possible. So pointing to these sections where people can find things, even with a large document like this which has quite a bit of substance to it, you can still impose a structure to this so that people can navigate it and find the interesting bits of work. So if somebody's only really interested in how you've approached the problem space of creativity in requirements elicitation for collaborative work, for instance, which is a bit of a mouthful, you can scroll down to the section on that which is chapter 6 to say, okay, they've done some requirements elicitation work here, they're trying to understand what people want from these systems. You can then scroll down to the approaches, you can see how they've embedded different types of creative approaches to requirements gathering, and then you can navigate to those sections. Rather than just sitting down and reading the document as a whole and saying, okay, I've read 177 pages now and realised this isn't relevant to my research, I've probably wasted a day's worth of reading and I haven't found out anything useful. So again, you're going to want to spend lots of time trying to discern meaning from things as a good researcher, as a good scientist, and so you want to maximise the amount you can get done in that time. Instead of spending, you know, 40 hours a week trying to work on a problem space, this might take it down to 10 hours, 5 hours, or maybe even 2 or 3 hours, and then you can spend the rest of your time more productively. So if you're a researcher who's writing papers, who's writing out research, who's formalising document structures, make sure that you embed a structure that people can access that's accessible, easy to understand, where people can elicit things from it quite quickly and navigate this structure in a way that's meaningful. In the same sense, if you are looking at this as a kind of external researcher, so you're wanting to engage with other people's work, make sure you're embedding these processes. Make sure that your research includes things like these nice figures to help to understand things at a broad level. 
Something like a figure or a table can help you to understand things like structure more easily. So here's a nice example of how I did it in my research. So I had three separate studies which described the process, and then within each of those studies there was a level of depth that was required. So for one of those axes or axioms, as you might describe them if you're a mathematician, there is a process of trying to create something that's a deliverable, a deliverable component from this research, and there's one that focuses more broadly on the contextual implications. And as you work through these axes of going from the kind of basic specialised focus of trying to understand the quantifiable data, so essentially just taking lots of numbers and trying to compare and contrast, that's a level of depth that's not particularly interesting. We're very focused, it's very specific. And as you move down this trajectory, as you move down towards the more broader implications, we actually spend some time with larger groups of people trying to elicit the broader set of requirements versus looking at those very, very specific use cases in the first instance. 
So again, you take a figure like this and it can describe a process nice and easy for you, it can make things easy for you to understand. And what you want to do if you're a researcher is to produce lots of figures and tables to help improve the accessibility of your writing. And in the same sense, if you're an external researcher looking at these bits of work, you're going to want to use these to form the basis of your research. You'll find you're often referencing figures and tables in a quite systematic way to encourage the discussion to move further. So science really is about bringing these things and taking them to the next level, saying this person discussed X, so that might be study one. This person discussed Y, which could be study two. And then finally we'll move on to something that's more contemporary. So we'll say based on X and based on Y, we can move forward and start to investigate Z. And what that gives us is a nice framing for our research. It provides a discursive atmosphere where we can validate most of our findings through external research and then create something new that helps us to move to that next level where we can say okay, now as a scientist I'm doing something that's original. I'm making an original contribution to science. And generally speaking, if you want to publish work, that's the type of criteria that will be required for you to get those publications into place. So in terms of your discovery process, in terms of your engaging with research and writing research papers, try to follow a structure that loosely compiles in this manner, where you've got a nice descriptive abstract, where you've got lots of structure including tables, figures, nice headings to help people navigate with numerical representations of the pages that they can find things on, and then some structure imposed within that with sections and subsections where it's relevant. This will really help external researchers engage with your research and it will really help you in terms of actually structuring your research in a systematic methodological way, which is helpful to frame your own mindset and help you to think about what comes next. If you write these chapters up in formal sections, it will help you to understand what you've already covered and what you need to be moving on to next, based around your own discussion. So as I said, you know, you have an introductory chapter at the beginning of each section, you have some summary outcomes at the end, and it will help you to then settle that idea down, to put it down on paper and to move on to the next idea. So again, there's lots of reasons to do all these things that I've suggested. We're going to have some activities where we have a go at this ourselves, where we think about the structure of documents, but for now this is a nice primer to help you along the lines of trying to understand both how to write good research papers and how to engage with the wider discourse of research that's available to you as an academic.
