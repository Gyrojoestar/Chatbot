Now that you've completed the activity of drafting design heuristics for DAWs, let's take a moment to reflect on your experience. Reflection is key in understanding not just what you did, but why it matters. Ask yourself, what challenges did you face in identifying usability issues? Were there any moments where you found it difficult to balance creativity and efficiency? How did considering different user roles like performers, producers or agents change the way you thought about the design? Did you add colour? Metrics? How did you know how to prioritise one thing over another? Think about the heuristics that you developed. 
How might these guidelines influence future design decisions, not just in this space but in other areas of technology? Reflection helps solidify these insights and allows you to apply them in a broader context. Efficiency might be pivotal in the context of a financial trading system, where seconds could mean millions of pounds. For scientific applications, effectiveness might be a priority even at the cost of speed. Software design is strange in that there's always a trade-off. We very rarely get to have the best of both worlds, but instead focus on incremental improvements. Take a minute to write down your thoughts or share them with a colleague. Reflecting on this process will deepen your understanding of how design can support or hinder creativity and usability in the digital space. Don't be frightened to put recommendations out there either. If there's something you can teach someone else, that's a worthwhile endeavour. At least I think so. I try to make a career out of it. We're about to move on to presenting content orally in a second. The rules are generally the same. Much like these lectures, you can generate a script and follow along. We'll jump straight in with an activity and then reflect on it when we're done. It's sometimes helpful to do something and then look for mistakes, like our heuristics, so that we can see room for improvement. I'll be back soon to discuss how to assess the piece of work you're about to do, so hold tight.
