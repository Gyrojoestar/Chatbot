So I'm going to try to describe how to take some really complex information and turn it into something meaningful. Now, the way that we often do this with research projects is we try to take really complex data and turn it into fairly simple visualizations that people can read and interpret and understand. Now, this is more difficult than it looks. It sounds like a simple process, but I'll talk about why this is such a difficult set of activities to engage in, and some of the tools and techniques that we use to do this. So I'll talk about some of my practical experience of translating a fairly complex set of processes into something that derives meaning from these processes. So the project I worked on to do a lot of this work was called the FAST project. It was the Fusing Semantic Audio Technologies project. It was about a £6 million project. 
It was a big research project done with EPSRC and in collaboration with a number of universities and industry partners. But the process behind this was trying to discern meaning from existing processes and look for design opportunities to create new or better systems. So we explored music making practices and looked at the production process to try to understand opportunities for improvement and opportunities for innovation. So there was a real focus on understanding the how of music making, how music was made, the methods that people engaged in, the practices that both musicians and producers engaged in to create successful musical products. And the fieldwork encapsulates the complex practice that is producing music. So we did a lot of fieldwork to understand those aspects of how and why. In many ways, the quantifiable data that we use from studies can be really, really helpful. But sometimes we actually have to spend some time in situ to really understand some of these subtle complexities. 
The things like how people are motivated to do things, what motivates them to do a particular thing in a particular way, and so on and so forth. And so when we design and describe systems, we often do that from the perspective of having a really good understanding about what our users are doing, how they're engaging with systems, and what the potential for improving upon those processes is. So these complex field reports give us a starting point for trying to discern the practical implications for design. Now the challenge behind this is that even when you've done these complex field-based reports and you've produced these 300, 500 page documents, the raw data in this qualitative format still lacks meaning. So you can describe what people are doing and how they're doing it, but you can't necessarily discern a set of design goals from it. You can't necessarily propose a system from these complexities. Because the documents are so complex and there's so much embedded within them, you have to spend some time really understanding them and translating them into something that somebody else can use. So these types of documents typically describe actions and motivations, things people are doing and things that they'd like to achieve. As an example of this, we might see somebody clicking on track two and then they might adjust the microphone position. They might then say something like, that sounds better, the bass response is better in the mix. Now what this essentially means is that there's an improvement in this process. So they physically change the environment, they physically change the position of a piece of hardware, and that's translated into an improvement in the overall process, which is good. So we can see from this, from their actions and the thing that they've said about their actions, that there's some positive reason for doing this. So this is what we mean by design opportunities. There is an opportunity here, for instance, to automate moving the mic into specific positions. So maybe that's a design implication for something like a robot or something like some automation in changing the configuration of a system. It gives us some room for improvement. But this isn't quite useful for designing a system yet, because we don't really understand if this is something that's generalizable, if it's something that's common that happens, and if it's going to be useful for more than one individual user. So we want to see that this is generalizable in the sense of it having more than a single use case. 
So this is typically what this work looks like. So you might have somebody playing an instrument, it's plugged into a physical interface, they're listening to it as they play. They're also clicking around in the interface to change the sound of the composition. So it's not an easy thing to do, because what you're often doing in this process is what you're listening to on the instrument in the kind of raw format it's in. For an acoustic guitar like this, for instance, with some digital input, what this will be is you just jamming around, just listening to the chords and how they sound in your natural environment. When you apply things like microphones or effects or settings, how that sounds in a digital context changes because you're moving from the analog space into something digital. And so there's a lot of work that goes into clicking around this interface, what we refer to as the digital audio workstation. You can see this in the bottom, where we've got that nice long waveform, which describes the audio. It describes the composition in its current format, and we apply lots of effects to things. So we will stretch this out and change the pitch and do lots of things to try to adjust this to make it sound better for a digital environment. Just remember, that's how people are going to be listening to this. This isn't something that's done in a live setting. As you can see here, I'm playing my guitar, but there's nobody else in the room. It's just me. I'm not playing just for my own purposes. 
I'm recording something, and so it's going to go somewhere. This could potentially be streamed by millions of people. So unless you know the audience, you're not really sure how to translate this into something digital. But this process of changing the effects, messing around with the composition in this digital format is really thinking about the end product of how this is going to out, how it's going to be listened to by a group of people. So there's a process of translation from these complex documents describing that example we saw in the last slide, where we're trying to produce something for purpose, and we're looking at three things effectively. We're looking at existing best practice, so things that work, things that are working well in the system that we want to copy effectively in our design of a new system and say, those things are good. We want to emulate those practices. What you might find is this comes largely from your market research. So if you're working on projects and doing these types of things, you might find you're looking at similar things that your competitors are doing. So a classic example of this is blue underlined hyperlinks. We generally see this as blue underlined. Wherever we go on the web, everybody follows the same conventions and practices. It makes sense to emulate those practices in most settings. We don't want to reinvent the wheel too much because there's no reason to do that. It would just create confusion. So we want to embed best practice in what we do. We want to look for opportunities for improvement. So if there's a problem with an existing system or something isn't as effective or efficient as it could be, then we look for ways in which we can improve upon those processes. And then finally, when looking through these research reports, we're also looking for opportunities for innovation, where we can create a new system that will help improve upon existing processes in a new and interesting way. What we often call the novelty proposition. There's something new coming from this process that allows us to create a new type of system, a new type of algorithm, a new type of interaction that will help to improve upon these processes. 
So the example might be producing a robot that changes that microphone position for us. That's an innovative solution to this problem. In many cases, you won't be working in innovative ways, you'll just be thinking about improving on existing processes. But there are always going to be a handful of design improvements that are possible through innovation alone. Now the real challenge with this type of stuff is that even when you do these field reports and you embed this complexity in these complex documents, they're still very hard to read and interpret things from. So you have two problems, really. The first is you've got a high volume of information. With field-based studies, there's usually a lot of observational work that goes into them. They're very long, they're very cumbersome, they're not very accessible. It's not the easiest way to interpret and access information through these long reports where you just have to read about the very mundane details of day-to-day stuff. 
When you're engaging in these types of field studies, what you'll often find is that you have to report everything. You don't get to make the decision about, I'm not going to write about this because it might not be useful down the line. You capture everything and then you decide further down the line whether or not you're going to use these things. So you're looking at high volume of data and also high complexity. So they might be talking about technical things, there might be technical processes going on. You have to try to understand both of these things when you're producing these reports and then even more so when you're translating them into some other format. So the subtleties and the nuances are really where you want to spend most of your time. 
So when you look at these kind of complex reports and you read three or four of these really complex reports, if you have the time, then there's really only two ways that you can visualize this complex data. And there's two dimensions that you can describe this trajectory of data across. So the first is really about actions and intents. So if you're used to using system design activities in your life, you might find this manifest as a use case or some kind of activity diagram which describes a behavioral process. These are quite common in lots of agile processes in looking at use cases, often referred to as user stories, which describe largely actions and intents. And then more broadly, you might want to look at the state of the process. So something like a sequence diagram will be an example of this. But in terms of this process, you're looking at both actions and intents and state of the process as being equally important. So imagine you're driving somewhere, you will generally engage in a series of actions and intents. So that will be you mirroring, you signaling, you maneuvering, you engaging in all of these processes that are mechanical in nature. There are actions and there are things that you're hoping to achieve by those actions. So you press on the accelerator pedal with the hope or the intent that the car will move more quickly. And the additional pressure that you apply to that pedal will increase the speed you're traveling at. Now those mechanical processes, they're very important. You need to know the mechanical process of driving, but you also need to understand the state that you're in when you're driving a vehicle. So you need to know where you are, you need to know where you're going, you need to know how close you are to the target destination, and so on and so forth. So an example of this might be the car itself manifests lots of actions and intents that you can engage in for different driving conditions. So you might want to change the mode that you're driving in. If you're driving in a sports utility vehicle, for instance, you might want to change the mode if it's snowy to make sure that you're using all four wheels to give you that drive to make sure that your car doesn't veer off the road. You also want to understand the state of the process. 
So you need to know where you're going, you need to know all the restrictions, you probably want to know how long it's going to take you as well. So if you're stuck in traffic, you're late to work, for instance, then you're going to know how late you are. So you can call up and say, I'm going to be 15, 20, 30 minutes late. So again, both of these types of information are really useful, but in different contexts of understanding what you're trying to achieve. Now the flow of information is something that looks like this. So we take these field reports and we translate them into steps or stages in a process. So they start out with initiation. 
Somebody has an idea for a song, they share materials together, they rehearse, they practice together, they locate a place that they can produce the music, they circulate parts of the composition. This is very boring and mundane, and this is a level of abstraction above the detailed reports that we'll see. But we need to understand the steps in the process. And we need to look at these series of reports to understand generalizable criteria about how people engage with the system in a flow oriented way to understand step one, step two, step four, step five, step 100. If we're designing systems for people, then we need to understand that flow of information. It's key to helping us to describe the types of systems that they might want to engage with. Now the concerns are also important. It's not just about actionable insights, it's about understanding the underlying conditions in which this system is going to work. So here's a quote from a participant from one of the studies. It says, verses for me are where the art form comes into it. I always try to be conscious about how layered my verses are with double meanings and conscious thought. 
The wording in verses for me is very important and I'm often caught in balance between keeping a rhyming pattern and saying something clever, meaningful, or just funny. Therefore, I build my verses line by line, often like a puzzle, where I know the structure it needs to keep to sound easier on the ears. I just need to find the right words to fit in the structure to express my point. This tells us a lot. Something simple like this, a simple quote that isn't particularly long, can tell us a lot about how to design a system. So we know that the participant has a preconceived notion about what they're going to be producing. They have an understanding about the architecture, the structure. They've got a general sense of certain words, the play on words mechanism. Their view of this, this analogy of a puzzle I really like, because it's about thinking about how the pieces fit together. A composition of audio is not just about it's one layer of things. It's one component part. It's often lots of instruments layered on top of one another, lots of vocal elements together, harmonics, etc, etc. So we take these concerns and preoccupations alongside the activities they're engaging in, and then we try to match them together in a meaningful way. So again, it's getting even more complex at this stage. Now the practical implications of this might be something like this. We've got a nice visual here of how the system looks to them. They've got a series of compositional component parts here. So we've got some drums, we've got a kick drum, which is a bass drum. We've got a snare, various other instruments in there. 
And the levels for each instrument are set at a particular amplitude. What you'll often find with these compositions is they're also panned in a particular way. So one sound will be coming out of the left side speaker, one will be coming out of the right, one will be more central. So the configuration of the audio is done inside the interface. So there's some practical ways that you can do this. And we can see from the actual practical elements of how they interact with the system, what they're trying to retrieve through these compositional processes. It's not just about that thing that they described. 
It's not just about the things that they're doing, but all of this information together, which is really rich, contextually nuanced. Now the starting point for this, when I started visualizing these complexities, was really understanding the mapping of these two things together. So we looked at concerns and preoccupations, and we looked at practices, and we tried to find a way to map the two together. So the commonality of, I am concerned, or I have a preoccupation with doing this thing. And then finally, the practical ways in which they manifested this to come about, making things come to fruition through practical strategies. I click this, I did that, versus I want to achieve this, and I want to achieve that. And then we looked at generalizable properties of these things. 
So you can see that table at the top, which describes the generalizable properties of things like project initiation. They all contained a series of concerns and preoccupations coded with O. So you can see O3, O4, O5, O7. And then they map to a set of practices. In that example, we have P3, P16, P17, P19, and P29. So the idea behind this is that we were able to look at what they were trying to do, and why they were trying to do a particular thing, and then the activities that they're engaging. This gives us a really nice starting point for translating those really complex details into a meaningful set of visual things that we can do to describe these processes. 
And this is the first starting point for this. This is the first useful visual we can provide, which is a tabular structure, a nice X, Y representation, where we map two things against one another so that we can start to see patterns. And each one of these two tables has an X, Y representation. We map concerns and preoccupations against a series of practices, and then we map a series of stages of the project from project initiation right the way through distribution as both a series of occupations or preoccupations, concerns, and practices. So again, we're looking at this mapping between objects to help us to discern interesting bits of information as we go through. Now the next step we can look at this is generalizing through a series of processes. So trying to move up a level of abstraction from, okay, we looked at those very specific things that the people were doing. 
We look for common trends in their behaviors, and then we map those common trends across a series of activities that are generalizable. So we've got a concept of pre-production, production, post-production, and delivery phases. So these are the general processes that people engage in when they're making music. If we look at the table, we've got a nice visual structure just under the table that describes that process. We've used the color scheme for that, as well as a numerical scheme to help us in describing those processes. So again, we start with project initiation, but that comes first, and then we finish up with distribution. And there are steps and stages that have to happen between those processes that we're then able to loosely group up and say those things have commonalities. 
So for instance, in pre-production, we start with step two, which is planning and preparation, and we finish with signing the sound. We then hand over to the next phase, which is production. And then at step eight, we hand over to post-production. And then in step 13, we move over to the delivery phases. So we've taken all those complex details, mapped them into a series of tables, taken that then and produced a clear visualization of steps and stages using both colors and numerical formats to describe. And then finally, we've got this really nice abstract representation at the bottom, which takes those thousands of pages of research reports and translates them into just five steps. Now, I think that's quite incredible that we're able to do that and discern meaning from things in such abstract ways. 
But that's not particularly useful in the format it's in either. So we need to think about how we can translate that into something more meaningful. So we can look at specific processes therein, or the processes that are contained therein, and try to discern meaning from each individual set of processes, while still keeping in mind that there are practical implications about the entire process happening from start to finish in a very specific order. So when we communicate this process, when we're trying to translate this to a set of design requirements, or perhaps to a group of users who are designing or developing this type of system, then we want to first of all simplify, but then develop a coding scheme and then group logically related items together. So we can look down at those detailed elements and visualize those, as we've done here, as a series of processes in collaboration, looking at essentially a conversation between two different artists of technical level, and looking at how they have that conversation and how they're able to collaborate in a social way to engage that process of collaborative music production, and look at that as a set of practical activities, and then look at how that fits against a broader scheme. So you can think of this like a standard. We've defined and described a standard protocol-oriented way of working. 
So we've got a series of activities that happen that are generalizable, that we can translate up to an abstract description of the processes and specifics around the orientation of those actions. So now we can step up to a level in which we're able to embed design interventions. We're able to build systems from this. So we can look down at each one of those parts of that complexity, that's still at a level of generalizability, where these aren't specifics about this one person does this thing, more these are the series of activities we tend to see within each of these phases of production. So for example, when we describe distribution, the distribution of music for purpose, we think about this as commercialization often. So people listening on streaming platforms, people going to buy a record or a CD, but there are inherent steps and stages within each one of these individual set of processes. So it depends on where this is distributed on how people engage with this type of system. 
So for instance, for the social media platforms, there's a process of archival, there's tagging of metadata, which is very important, the information about how this is produced, where it's going to go, how it's going to be communicated in a kind of semantic way, versus just the composition. Actually, this is now a digital artifact, which has all this metadata attached to it about the original artist and where it's come from and where it's going. There's then a process of a manifestation of activities again, so uploading the audio to the platform, posting to various social media channels, reposting in various other places and then these feedback loops. And then we can drill down another level and we can say, well, okay, what happens at these feedback levels? Well, there's a process of engagement in a socially augmented way online to communicate about your own music, about your own composition, how people feel about it, how people are listening to it. So we can then look at this as a broad visual structure to help us to understand where all the design opportunities fit in this broader context of things without spending lots of time looking at the mechanical actions of, they click a button, then they move a slider, then they drag something across the screen. This is discernible to somebody who's a designer or a developer to say, actually, there's some actions I can perform to create a system that will facilitate some or all of these activities or improve upon existing activities that exist. 
Now when you take this and you talk about a community of activities, you can also look at this as a kind of set of research outputs and say, well, let's talk to a wider community of people about problems with existing systems. Let's talk about how people work with existing systems. And we can do that in this context. So one of the outputs of this research project was the description and definition of what was called a digital music object. Now the classical way we think about music is often we hear a track on the radio and we sit down with a friend or a colleague and we say, did you hear that track? Did you like it? What did you think about that other catalog of music? 
It creates really interesting conversations. Music tends to be something that's quite a socially augmented activity. Within this context of music production, the idea of a piece of music being a composition that sits alone by itself is probably a dated idea. And if you look at how music is produced and consumed, there's lots of activities that people tend to engage in at different levels. So there might be remixing, there might be reproduction of things. There might be a process by which something is fixed or improved upon. So you often see that tracks that have been created 30, 40 years beforehand are then reproduced again using contemporary technologies to create a better mix, to create a better version of that song. 
So there's all these things going on, again, sometimes happening synchronously, sometimes asynchronously, that can really help to embed this augmented social practice that I think improves upon music, generally speaking, if music is embedding the best practice of existing music, but also innovating in some new ways. It means that music can constantly be produced that's both new and old in the way it's defined. So we could think about this in a very, very simple way. Again, this is a visual way that we could describe this. We start out with the idea at a very basic level that music is a composition, that we sit down and we record something on an instrument, and that's the end of the process. But actually, when we look at these field-based studies, we can discern a lot more from them. We can see themes, we can see people engaging in repeated activities, we can see processes which are happening in multiple spaces. 
So the composition could become some sheet music, it could become some notation, it could become a recording which then might change a number of times over its life cycle. So that recording could go out to various different places in various different formats, YouTube, for instance, SoundCloud, various other platforms. For YouTube, it might be a video format, which could then be remixed by somebody else, and then somebody else beyond that process could take that remix and create an acoustic version of it. Somebody else could then come along and remix the acoustic version of the remix of the video. So what you'll find is that the composition could change through its life cycle. And this idea of a digital music object came about through these observational studies of how people interact with these types of systems. So this is really interesting. 
I think it gives us some sense of actually music isn't this static thing that just exists. We just create it, it exists, and then over time it just disappears. These are often practical things that exist and then get changed and manipulated and recreated and chopped back up and then put back together in interesting ways. All these different processes that help us to understand that music is evolving over time. So we started out with the idea of all these complexities around things like processes. So we see these on the left hand side, initiation, circulation of material, very boring, very mundane stuff. And we translate that over a series of exercises into something meaningful. 
On the right hand side we can see a nice visualization that describes what goes on in three sets of processes. So we've got three categories of actions. The first is about tagging music, indexing it, linking it, making sure it's storable and retrievable and that people can find it. That might also mean that you can find it in your own library of sounds. So often this is a self-driven process. There are motivations around putting things in places that you can find them and storing things in ways in which you can access that content. Again going back to that idea of metadata. 
And then the provenancing stuff, which is all about ownership. There's been a lot in the media recently about the ownership of musical compositions. There's been various legal cases about what it means to create original music. But what we can see from a lot of these life cycles is what that remixing culture looks like, how people adapt and change music, the tools of the trade that they use in engaging in these processes, the signing of the sound, which is a really original process to each composer, to each mixing and mastering engineer. There's a very specific set of activities they engage in, which is personal to them, which is really about branding and marketing. I make music that sounds a particular way. And so I brand myself in that way and there are a series of activities that I engage in in my creative practice that mean that I sign the sound to make it sound like my music, which is a really important process. 
And then finally the stuff around legality. So the copywriting of information, intellectual property, which is often defined as IP, and then reusability to make things accessible for other people. So lots of these communities of people we engage with looked at the reusability of their compositions because they want other people to use their component parts in their composition. So through this process, what we find is that we take these really complex, very wordy field reports and translate them into something meaningful. So we produce a meaningful visualization which describes the structure of the component parts of the system, and then that can be translated into something that is for a particular community of people, whether that's a general research community talking about problems in existing systems and ways in which we can improve those systems, or looking for opportunities for design innovation where a new system could come about as a result of these findings. So what we're often doing with trying to visualize information is we're trying to make it more accessible, trying to help everybody to be able to access that information in a meaningful way which is easy to understand and interpret. So when you're producing your research reports, when you're doing research and communicating ideas and concepts in factual ways, in descriptive ways, you want to rely heavily on visualizations. 
And the two types of visualizations that are really important for you are tabular-based visualizations where you can take a table, an XY representation, mapping one thing against some other things, a really good way to describe complexity in systems, and the other way is through visual structures, what we often refer to as figures. So if you've got a visual way that you can describe a component, an idea, a concept, particularly for interrelated concepts, this can be really useful. Those two types of techniques will really help to bring your research and communication along and help other people to engage with those things in practical ways. So these are the things you want to consider in the work that you're doing when you're trying to produce compelling, rich, interesting visualizations.
