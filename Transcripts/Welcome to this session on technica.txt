Welcome to this session on technical writing. In this video, we're going to explore what technical writing is, why it's essential in the field of computer science, and how you can develop strong technical writing skills that will help you to succeed both in your studies and in your future career. So what is technical writing? In simple terms, technical writing involves communicating complex information clearly and effectively, usually to a specific audience. It often includes instructions, manuals, reports, and documentation related to technical subjects like software development, engineering, and scientific research. Unlike other forms of writing, technical writing is focused on clarity, accuracy, and above all being concise. It's not about crafting a compelling story or showcasing your personal style. 
It's about making sure your audience understands the technical information you're presenting, no matter how complex it might be. Now you might be wondering why technical writing is so important, especially in computer science. Here are a few key reasons. Technical writing is essential for creating clear and detailed documentation. Whether you're writing software documentation, APIs, user manuals, or system architecture descriptions, the goal is to make complex systems and processes easy to understand for the end user or stakeholder. In the tech industry, collaboration is key. Teams of developers, engineers, and non-technical stakeholders often need to work together. 
Technical writing helps bridge the gap between these groups by providing clear communication that everyone can follow. It ensures that everyone is on the same page, whether they're writing code or making business decisions. Imagine you have to communicate an idea to a senior backend developer. Now imagine you have to communicate the same information to someone who works as a communications manager or in the marketing team. You have to utilize strategies that make your content as accessible as possible to as wide an audience as possible. Well-written documentation saves time. Whether you're onboarding new team members or troubleshooting issues, or implementing systems, clear documentation prevents misunderstandings, reduces the need for repeated explanations, and helps avoid costly mistakes. 
You will see this in other modules from the perspective of test-driven development or in sifting through design guidelines, but the key is to recognize diversity and improve accessibility of your content. Strong technical writing skills can set you apart in the job market. Many employers value candidates who can not only solve technical problems, but also communicate their solutions effectively. Whether you're creating technical reports, presenting project updates, or writing code comments, these skills are essential. There are lots of jobs in this space, particularly in the domains of publishing and user experience design. What makes good technical writing? Let's break down a few essential characteristics. 
The most important trait of technical writing is clarity. Your audience needs to understand the message you're delivering. To achieve this, use simple language whenever possible. Avoid jargon unless you're sure your audience is familiar with the terminologies. If you have to use technical terminology, be sure to define it clearly. Simple things like a glossary of terms can help make the content much more accessible. As a general rule, you should at least define an abbreviation the first time you use it. 
Be concise. Your goal is to communicate information as efficiently as possible. Avoid unnecessary details or overly complex sentences that could confuse your readers. Get straight to the point while ensuring that nothing essential is left out. You'll notice when we look at technical documents that most sentences are simple, with a handful of complex or compound sentences to break up the monotony. Technical writing must be accurate. A single mistake can lead to misunderstandings, wasted time, and even serious errors in a project. 
Always double-check your facts, figures, and instructions to make sure they are correct. Imagine if I told you that this module was 1,500 notional hours of study instead of 150. I'm sure you'd have a lot to say about it. Good technical writing is well-organized. Use clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break down your information. This makes your writing easier to follow and helps your audience find the information that they need quickly. As a general rule of thumb, I like to go about four subheadings deep before it gets confusing. 
An easy way to remember this is to think about it like an IP address. 1.1.1.1.1 is invalid. Technical writing should be objective and neutral. You are presenting facts and information, not opinions. Avoid subjective language and stay focused on delivering accurate and useful content to your audience. You might get a little bit of opportunity to make some more reaching points in your discussion and evaluation chapters, but again you should be able to back this up with rigorous empirical evidence. I prefer dogs to cats is fine. 
Dogs are better than cats, while objectively true might need substantiating. Let's take a look at some of the common types of technical writing you may encounter in computer science. User manuals and guides. These documents are written for end-users to help them to understand how to use a product, whether it's software or hardware. The goal is to explain functionality in a clear and easy-to-understand way. Have a look at the man pages in Unix, or documentation for your favourite programming language, to get a sense of the flavour. API documentation explains how developers can interact with a software application or service. 
It provides details on how to make requests, what responses to expect, and any necessary configurations or dependencies. Most of what you work with will either be a framework or an API, and you probably already have lots of experience of this one. Technical reports are used to present findings, recommendations or project updates. This might include software performance evaluations, system architecture proposals or project milestones. These tend to talk to very specific audiences and are usually targeted as such. Presenting comments in your code is also a form of technical writing. Good comments explain what your code is doing, why certain decisions were made, and how other developers can modify or use the code. 
This can be difficult to master, but you generally expect to see short comments for relatively complex tasks. Where an algorithm or piece of code is a bit more complex, then you may see a more detailed description of exactly what is happening to help with understanding, maintainability, and even refactoring. Plug strings in Python are a really good example of this, explaining exactly what a given piece of code is doing. White papers and research papers. These are often more formal and in-depth, typically written for a highly technical audience. They present new research, findings, or approaches to solving specific technical problems. I've written papers on adaptive audio systems, digital gifting, hackable digital music instruments, and digital audio workstation usability. 
Each one of these had a slightly different style, tone, and level of technical language. What is common in these is that they facilitate an interesting discourse around some novel design, idea, concept, or technical proposition. I usually start by reading the abstract, then the conclusion. If both are interesting, I tend to read the rest of the paper. Make sure that these two sections really explain exactly what is going on in as few words as possible. Now that we know what technical writing involves, let's break down the process of writing a technical document into a few key steps. Before you start writing, consider who your audience is. 
Are they experts in the field, or are they non-technical stakeholders? Tailoring your writing to your audience is critical. If you're writing for developers, you can use technical jargon and dive deep into code explanations. But if you're writing for managers or clients, you'll need to simplify the content and focus on higher-level concepts. A really good research paper can speak to lots of audience as well, but you cannot always get away from hardcore mathematical constructs or some inherent complexity. It's about communicating this in the most accessible way possible. It's better to speak to a million people than one person. 
What is the goal of your document? Are you providing instructions, explaining a concept, or summarising research? Knowing the purpose of your document will help you to stay focused and ensure that all the relevant information is included. Lots of research will start with a literature review, which brings in existing ideas. It is often later in the paper when you start to realise what the novel contribution is – something new appearing on the foundation of lots of existing, pre-established ideas and well-tested theories. Once you have your purpose and audience in mind, organise your information logically. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points and diagrams to structure your document. 
Start with the most important information and work your way down to the details. I find sticky notes are useful for this. You can then group them into themes and concepts to start to fold down mutual concepts into simpler constructs. Now it's time to write. Remember to use clear, simple language and maintain an objective tone. Start your introduction first, giving your reader an overview of what the document will cover. Then, move into the body, where you present your information in a structured way. 
You can start with bullet points or tables and then extrapolate from there. Once you've written your draft, review it carefully. Check for clarity, conciseness and accuracy. Edit any sections that seem too complex or unclear and correct any errors. It's also a good idea to get feedback from others, especially if you're writing for a technical audience. The peer review process helps with this when producing technical manuscripts and also acts as a check and measure for quality. There are many tools and resources available to help you improve your technical writing. 
Here are a few that you might find helpful. Markdown or LaTeX for formatting technical documents. These tools are widely used for creating clean, structured documents, especially for documentation and reports. We actually use LaTeX for formatting your examination scripts. You're also familiar with Markup from your HTML classes, which are also about building semantic structure into a page. AI tools for checking grammar, style and readability. There are even libraries in Python for natural language processing that can help with improving style or rewriting components. 
Graphics design software for creating visual aids like flowcharts, diagrams and process maps. API documentation tools for generating and documenting APIs. In this module, you'll get a chance to look at some of these, but as part of your working life, you'll be exposed to many more. To wrap up, let's review the key takeaways from today's video. Technical writing is essential for clear communication in the tech industry, especially when working on complex projects or explaining systems to diverse audiences. Some concepts cannot be explained in code or through mathematical concepts alone. Good technical writing should be clear, concise, accurate, well-organized and written with an objective tone. 
There are many types of technical writing, including user manuals, API documentation, technical reports and research papers. Always start by understanding your audience and purpose, then structure your writing logically and revise carefully for clarity. Developing strong technical writing skills will not only help you succeed in this course, but will also be an invaluable asset throughout your career. Thank you for watching and in the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into exploring the anatomy of a technical document.
